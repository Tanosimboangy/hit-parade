		Makes me forget that I still need her so
		Red, red wine, it's up to you
		All I can do I've done
		Memories won't go, memories won't go
		I'd have sworn that with time
		Thoughts of you leave my head
		I was wrong, now I find
		Just one thing makes me forget
		Red, red wine, stay close to me
		Don't let me be alone
		It's tearing apart my blue heart
		I'd have sworn that with time
		Thoughts of you leave my head
		I was wrong, now I find
		Just one thing makes me forget
		Red, red wine, stay close to me
		Don't let me be alone
		It's tearing apart my blue heart
		Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
		You keep me rockin' all of the time
		Red red wine, you make me feel so grand
		I feel a million dollar when you're just in my hand
		Red red wine, you make me feel so sad
		Anyâ€¦`,
